# Original:

# Set the command-line arguments to pass to the server.
# Due to shell escaping, to pass backslashes for regexes, you need to double
# them (\\d for \d). If running under systemd, you need to double them again
# (\\\\d to mean \d), and escape newlines too.
# On sysvinit systems, when changing the configuration pathname also
# change it in the init script.
